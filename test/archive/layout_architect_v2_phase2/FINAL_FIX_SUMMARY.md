# Layout Architect Test Suite - Final Fix Summary

## ✅ GEMINI_API_KEY Issue - FIXED

### Problem
The tests were failing with:
```
pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError: Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable or pass it via `GoogleGLAProvider(api_key=...)`to use the Google GLA provider.
```

This was happening because pytest wasn't loading the `.env` file, so the environment variables weren't available during test execution.

### Solution Implemented
Updated `test/layout_architect_v2_phase2/conftest.py` to:
1. Load the `.env` file using python-dotenv
2. Automatically convert `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `GEMINI_API_KEY` if needed

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
env_path = os.path.join(project_root, '.env')
if os.path.exists(env_path):
    load_dotenv(env_path)
    print(f"Loaded .env file from: {env_path}")

# Also set GEMINI_API_KEY from GOOGLE_API_KEY if needed
if not os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY") and os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
    print("Set GEMINI_API_KEY from GOOGLE_API_KEY")
```

### Result
✅ The environment variables are now loaded correctly when running tests
✅ Both `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` formats are supported
✅ Tests can now access the API keys

## ⚠️ Test API Mismatch Issue - DISCOVERED

### New Problem
After fixing the API key issue, the tests are now failing with:
```
TypeError: ThemeAgent.generate_theme() got an unexpected keyword argument 'slide_type'
```

### Analysis
The test suite was written for an older version of the Layout Architect agents. The current implementation:
- Uses pydantic_ai's Agent pattern
- Has different method signatures
- The ThemeAgent doesn't have a `generate_theme()` method

### Next Steps Required
The test suite needs to be updated to match the current agent implementations:
1. Review the actual agent APIs in the current code
2. Update test methods to use the correct agent interfaces
3. Ensure test data matches expected formats

## Summary
- ✅ Environment variable loading is fixed
- ✅ API keys are now available to tests
- ⚠️ Tests need to be updated to match current agent APIs

To run tests now, simply use:
```bash
pytest test/layout_architect_v2_phase2/
```

The `.env` file will be loaded automatically.
