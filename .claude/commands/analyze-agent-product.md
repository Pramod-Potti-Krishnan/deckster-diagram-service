# Analyze Agent Product Command

## Overview
This command analyzes a product concept document and produces a detailed functional specification with all requirements, functionalities, and data architecture needed for agent development.

## Usage
```
/analyze-agent-product <path-to-product-concept.md>
```

## Output
Creates: 
- `/docs/plan/[AgentName]_Product_Analysis.md` - Detailed functional specification
- `/docs/product/[AgentName]_Product_Description.md` - Product description document

## Process

### Phase 1: Initial Product Analysis

Read and analyze the provided product concept document to understand:
- Core goals and objectives
- Target users and use cases
- High-level requirements
- Integration context
- Success criteria
- **Agent name(s)** - Extract for file naming

**Important**: Check if the document describes multiple agents. If so, create separate analysis documents for each agent:
- `/docs/plan/[AgentName1]_Product_Analysis.md`
- `/docs/plan/[AgentName2]_Product_Analysis.md`

### Phase 2: Detailed Functionality Definition

Whether the product concept has detailed specifications or not, create a comprehensive functionality breakdown:

#### 2.1 Core Functionality Analysis
1. **Identify Primary Goals**: What are the main objectives this agent must achieve?
2. **Break Down into Specific Functions**: List all discrete tasks the agent must perform
3. **Define Success Criteria**: How do we measure if each function succeeds?
4. **Map User Interactions**: Document all ways users will interact with the agent
5. **Identify Data Requirements**: What data does each function need?

#### 2.2 Functionality Documentation Template
```markdown
## Detailed Functionalities for [Agent Name]

### Primary Functions
1. **[Function Name]**
   - Purpose: [What it accomplishes]
   - Trigger: [When/how it's invoked]
   - Input Requirements:
     - Data: [What data it needs]
     - Format: [Expected format]
     - Validation: [Rules/constraints]
   - Processing Steps:
     - Step 1: [Description]
     - Step 2: [Description]
   - Output Specification:
     - Data: [What it produces]
     - Format: [Output format]
   - Success Criteria: [Measurable outcomes]
   - Error Scenarios: [What could go wrong]
   - Dependencies: [Other functions/systems needed]

### Supporting Functions
[Similar structure for supporting functions]

### User Interaction Flows
1. **[Flow Name]**
   - Entry Point: [How user initiates]
   - Steps: [User journey]
   - Decision Points: [Where choices are made]
   - Exit Points: [How flow completes]
```

### Phase 3: Memory and State Analysis

#### 3.1 Analyze Current Supabase Architecture

Review the existing database schema to understand:

1. **Current Session Structure**:
   ```sql
   -- Document the current sessions table
   sessions:
     - id: UUID
     - user_id: TEXT
     - current_state: TEXT
     - conversation_history: JSONB
     - user_initial_request: TEXT
     - clarifying_answers: JSONB
     - confirmation_plan: JSONB
     - presentation_strawman: JSONB
     - refinement_feedback: TEXT
     - created_at: TIMESTAMP
     - updated_at: TIMESTAMP
   ```

2. **Identify Agent Memory Needs**:
   - What state must persist across interactions?
   - What is temporary/working memory?
   - What context is needed for each function?
   - How does memory relate to user sessions?

3. **Design Memory Architecture**:
   ```markdown
   ## Memory Requirements
   
   ### Working Memory (Session-based)
   - [Item]: [Why needed, lifecycle]
   
   ### Persistent Memory (Database)
   - [Item]: [Why needed, storage strategy]
   
   ### Context Requirements
   - [Function]: [Context needed]
   ```

4. **Propose Schema Changes**:
   ```sql
   -- Example: Additional columns for sessions
   ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN [agent_name]_state JSONB;
   
   -- Example: New tables if needed
   CREATE TABLE [agent_name]_memory (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       session_id UUID REFERENCES sessions(id),
       memory_type TEXT NOT NULL,
       data JSONB NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

### Phase 4: Integration Analysis

#### 4.1 System Integration Points
- How does this agent fit into Deckster's workflow?
- Which existing components will it interact with?
- What new WebSocket message types are needed?
- How does it integrate with the Director agent?

#### 4.2 Data Flow Mapping
```markdown
## Data Flow Analysis

### Input Sources
1. **[Source]**: [Type of data, format, frequency]

### Processing Pipeline
1. **[Stage]**: [What happens to data]

### Output Destinations
1. **[Destination]**: [What receives output, format]
```

### Phase 5: Technical Requirements

Based on the functional analysis, define:

1. **Performance Requirements**:
   - Response time expectations
   - Throughput needs
   - Concurrency requirements

2. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - Expected load
   - Growth projections
   - Resource constraints

3. **Security Requirements**:
   - Data sensitivity
   - Access controls needed
   - Compliance requirements

### Phase 6: Success Metrics

Define measurable success criteria:

1. **Functional Metrics**:
   - [Function]: [How to measure success]

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Response time targets
   - Error rate thresholds

3. **User Experience Metrics**:
   - User satisfaction indicators
   - Task completion rates

### Phase 7: Product Description Generation

Create a concise, user-friendly product description that:

1. **Explains the Agent's Purpose**: What problem does it solve?
2. **Highlights Key Features**: What makes it valuable?
3. **Describes User Benefits**: How does it help users?
4. **Lists Capabilities**: What can it do?
5. **Provides Use Cases**: When would users need it?
6. **Includes Integration Info**: How it fits in Deckster's ecosystem
