## Introduction: Why We Enhanced These Agents {#introduction}

Imagine you're creating a presentation. You want every slide to feel like it belongs together - same style, same tone, same professional polish. But doing this manually is time-consuming and often inconsistent.

That's the problem we solved with our enhanced Theme and Content Agents.

### The Old Way
- Each slide was styled independently
- Content was generated without knowing the overall story
- No consistent "brand" across the presentation
- Limited ability to pull in relevant external information

### The New Way
- A comprehensive "brand book" is created for the entire presentation
- Every slide knows the full story and its role in it
- Content automatically uses the right tone, colors, and style
- Can intelligently search for and incorporate relevant data

## The Theme Agent: Your Brand & Style Director {#theme-agent}

Think of the Theme Agent as a professional designer who looks at your entire presentation concept and creates a complete design system - like a "brand book" that ensures consistency.

### What It Does

The Theme Agent reads through your entire presentation outline (the "strawman") and extracts:

1. **The Mood and Vibe**
   - It identifies keywords like "innovative," "professional," "data-driven"
   - These become the personality of your presentation
   - Example: A tech startup pitch might extract: "innovative, bold, disruptive, forward-thinking"

2. **Color Palette**
   - Creates a harmonious set of colors that match the mood
   - Ensures all colors work well together and are accessible
   - Example: "innovative" might lead to electric blues and vibrant teals

3. **Typography (Fonts)**
   - Selects fonts that match your audience and tone
   - Pairs heading and body fonts that work well together
   - Example: Clean, modern sans-serif for a tech presentation

4. **Layout Templates**
   - Creates blueprints for different slide types
   - Ensures consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
   - Example: Data slides get specific zones for charts and insights

### The Tools Explained Simply

#### Mood Analysis Tool
- **What it does**: Reads your presentation description and extracts the "feeling"
- **Like hiring**: A psychologist who understands emotional tone
- **Example input**: "Modern data-driven approach to healthcare innovation"
- **Example output**: Keywords like "innovative," "analytical," "caring," "professional"

#### Color Palette Tool
- **What it does**: Creates a set of colors that work together
- **Like hiring**: An interior designer choosing a room's color scheme
- **Example**: For "professional + innovative" → Navy blue (trust) + Electric teal (innovation)
- **Ensures**: Colors are accessible for colorblind users

#### Font Pairing Tool
- **What it does**: Selects fonts that are readable and match the mood
- **Like hiring**: A typography expert for your brand
- **Example**: Executive presentation → Helvetica (clean, authoritative)
- **Considers**: Screen readability, formality level, audience age

#### Layout Template Tool
- **What it does**: Creates consistent "frames" for content
- **Like hiring**: An architect designing room layouts
- **Example**: Title slide → Large title zone at center, subtitle below
- **Ensures**: Content has proper breathing room

## The Content Agent: Your Chief Content Strategist {#content-agent}

The Content Agent is like having a team of expert writers, data analysts, and visual designers who all understand your presentation's story and style.

### What It Does

For each slide, the Content Agent:

1. **Understands Context**
   - Knows what comes before and after
   - Understands the slide's role in the overall narrative
   - Uses the theme's mood in all content

2. **Expands Content Intelligently**
   - Takes bullet points and creates presentation-ready text
   - Adjusts word count based on slide type and audience
   - Injects the theme's tone keywords naturally

3. **Searches for Information**
   - Can search internal company documents
   - Can search the web for statistics and trends
   - Always tracks sources for credibility

4. **Specifies Visuals Completely**
   - Creates detailed specifications for charts, images, and diagrams
   - Uses theme colors and styles in all visuals
   - Provides enough detail for designers or AI to create the visual

### The Four Expert Modes

#### 1. Content Writer Mode
- **Activates for**: Text-heavy slides
- **Acts like**: A copywriter who knows your brand voice
- **Example**: Transforms "Increase efficiency" → "Streamline operations to boost productivity by 40%, empowering teams to focus on innovation"
- **Uses theme**: Injects mood keywords naturally into text

#### 2. Data Storyteller Mode
- **Activates for**: Slides with analytics or metrics
- **Acts like**: A data analyst who can visualize insights
- **Example**: Creates a revenue growth chart with:
  - Specific data points showing 25% year-over-year growth
  - Theme colors for the visualization
  - Key insight: "Consistent growth demonstrates market validation"
- **Special ability**: Can generate realistic synthetic data when needed

#### 3. Visual Briefer Mode
- **Activates for**: Slides needing imagery
- **Acts like**: An art director writing detailed briefs
- **Example**: For "Innovation in Action" slide:
  - Creates 200+ word image prompt
  - Specifies style: "Modern, dynamic, forward-thinking"
  - Includes lighting, composition, and mood details
  - Adds negative prompt (what to avoid)

#### 4. Diagram Architect Mode
- **Activates for**: Process flows, organizational charts, etc.
- **Acts like**: A technical illustrator
- **Example**: For "Implementation Timeline":
  - Designs node structure (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3)
  - Specifies connections and relationships
  - Applies theme's visual style (geometric vs. organic)

### Search Capabilities

#### Internal Knowledge Search (RAG)
- **Purpose**: Find relevant company information
- **Like having**: Access to all company documents instantly
- **Example search**: "Q3 revenue figures"
- **Example result**: "Q3 revenue: $150M, up 25% YoY (Source: quarterly_report_2024_Q3.pdf)"

#### Web Search
- **Purpose**: Find industry statistics and trends
- **Like having**: A research assistant with internet access
- **Example search**: "Cloud computing market size 2027"
- **Example result**: "Market expected to reach $1.5T by 2027, 15.7% CAGR (Source: Statista)"

## How They Work Together {#collaboration}

The collaboration is like a movie production:

1. **Theme Agent = Production Designer**
   - Creates the visual style guide
   - Sets the mood and tone
   - Defines the "look and feel"

2. **Content Agent = Screenwriter + Director**
   - Writes the content following the style guide
   - Ensures each scene (slide) serves the story
   - Directs how visuals should look

### The Flow

```
1. Strawman (outline) created
   ↓
2. Theme Agent analyzes entire presentation
   - Extracts mood: "professional, innovative, data-driven"
   - Creates colors: Blue (#0066cc), Teal (#14b8a6)
   - Selects fonts: Inter for headings, Open Sans for body
   - Designs layouts: Title zones, content areas, visual spaces
   ↓
3. Content Agent receives:
   - The theme (design system)
   - Deck summary (2-paragraph story overview)
   - Individual slide to work on
   ↓
4. Content Agent creates:
   - Text using mood keywords
   - Visuals using theme colors
   - Layout respecting template zones
```

## Real-World Example {#example}

### Content Agent Process
