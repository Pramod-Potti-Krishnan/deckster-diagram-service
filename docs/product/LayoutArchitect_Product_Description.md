# Layout Architect Product Description

## Overview
The Layout Architect is an intelligent design agent that transforms your presentation content into visually stunning layouts. It continues seamlessly from Phase 1 after you approve your presentation strawman, acting as the bridge between strategic planning and visual execution. The Layout Architect first generates a complete presentation theme tailored to your content and audience, then analyzes each slide's content and automatically selects or creates the perfect layout, ensuring your presentations are both beautiful and effective at communicating your message. Its output provides essential guidance to all Phase 3 specialist agents.
