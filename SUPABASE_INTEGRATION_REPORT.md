# Supabase Integration Test Report

**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **Partially Working** (with RLS restrictions)

## Summary

Successfully restored and tested Supabase integration for the Diagram Microservice v2. The project was paused due to inactivity but has been successfully reactivated.

## Test Results

### 1. Project Status ✅
- **Project URL**: https://eshvntffcestlfuofwhv.supabase.co
- **Project ID**: eshvntffcestlfuofwhv
- **Status**: ACTIVE (was paused, now restored)
- **Services**: All responding

### 2. Authentication ✅
- **Anon Key**: Working correctly
- **Service Key**: Working correctly
- **Auth Service**: Responding

### 3. Storage Bucket ✅
- **Bucket Name**: `diagrams`
- **Access**: Public
- **Status**: Created successfully
- **Test Upload**: ✅ Working (via service key)
- **Public URL**: https://eshvntffcestlfuofwhv.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/diagrams/test_setup.svg

### 4. Integration Issues ⚠️

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Blocking Operations
The main issue preventing full integration is Row Level Security policies:

```
Error: new row violates row-level security policy
Code: 403 Unauthorized
```

This affects:
- Creating bucket entries in storage.buckets table
- Uploading files via anon key
- Database operations for session/diagram metadata

#### Solutions:

**Option 1: Use Service Role Key** (Quick Fix)
```python
# In .env, add:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# In storage/supabase_client.py, use service key:
supabase = create_client(url, service_key)  # Instead of anon_key
```

**Option 2: Configure RLS Policies** (Recommended for Production)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Allow anon users to upload to diagrams bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon uploads" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'diagrams');

-- Allow anon users to read from diagrams bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon reads" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'diagrams');
```

**Option 3: Disable RLS** (Testing Only)
```sql
-- WARNING: Only for testing!
ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE storage.buckets DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 5. Current Functionality

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Supabase Connection | ✅ Working | Project active |
| Storage Bucket | ✅ Created | Named 'diagrams' |
| File Upload (Service Key) | ✅ Working | Test file uploaded |
| File Upload (Anon Key) | ❌ Blocked | RLS policy issue |
| Public URL Generation | ✅ Working | Files are publicly accessible |
| Database Operations | ⚠️ Partial | RLS blocking some operations |
| WebSocket Integration | ✅ Working | Diagrams generated successfully |
| Storage Fallback | ✅ Working | Falls back to inline content when storage fails |

### 6. Files Tested

1. **test_supabase_ping.py** - Basic connectivity test
2. **setup_supabase_bucket.py** - Bucket creation and setup
3. **test_supabase_connection.py** - Full integration test
4. **test_websocket_simple.py** - WebSocket with Supabase

### 7. Test Execution Log

```bash
# 1. Initial test - Project was paused
python3 test_supabase_ping.py
# Result: HTTP 404 (paused)

# 2. After manual reactivation
python3 test_supabase_ping.py
# Result: All services responding

# 3. Bucket creation
python3 setup_supabase_bucket.py
# Result: Bucket created, test file uploaded

# 4. WebSocket test
python3 test_websocket_simple.py
# Result: Diagram generated, storage failed (RLS), fallback worked
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Storage Client**: Use service role key for storage operations
2. **Configure RLS Policies**: Set up proper policies for anon access
3. **Create Database Tables**: Ensure all required tables exist

### For Production
1. **Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication
2. **RLS Policies**: Configure row-level security for all tables
3. **Bucket Policies**: Set appropriate file size and type limits
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for storage quota and errors

### Configuration Updates Needed

Update `.env`:
```env
# Use service key for admin operations
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<your-service-key>
USE_SERVICE_KEY_FOR_STORAGE=true
```

Update `storage/supabase_client.py`:
```python
# Use service key when configured
key = settings.supabase_service_key if settings.use_service_key_for_storage else settings.supabase_key
```

## Conclusion

Supabase integration is **functional** with the following status:
- ✅ **Connection**: Active and responding
- ✅ **Storage**: Bucket created and accessible  
- ⚠️ **RLS Issues**: Blocking anon operations (needs configuration)
- ✅ **Fallback**: Working correctly when storage fails
- ✅ **Service Continuity**: No impact on diagram generation

The service remains fully operational even when Supabase storage fails, thanks to the inline content fallback mechanism. With proper RLS configuration or service key usage, full storage integration will work perfectly.
