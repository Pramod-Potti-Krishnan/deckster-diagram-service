# Analytics System Backup - Before Playbook Implementation

**Date Created**: 2024-08-11  
**Purpose**: Backup of original analytics system before implementing LLM-based playbook selection

## Backed Up Files

This directory contains backups of the original analytics system files before the playbook implementation:

1. **conductor.py.backup** - Original rule-based chart selection logic
2. **data_synthesizer.py.backup** - Original synthetic data generation
3. **python_chart_agent.py.backup** - Original Python chart creation
4. **mermaid_chart_agent.py.backup** - Original Mermaid chart generation
5. **analytics_agent.py.backup** - Original orchestration logic

## Why These Backups Exist

We're implementing a new LLM-based playbook system for intelligent chart selection. These backups ensure we can:
- Quickly rollback if issues arise
- Compare old vs new implementations
- Preserve working code as reference
- Maintain system stability during development

## How to Restore

### Automatic Rollback
Run the rollback script from the parent directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/analytics_utils
./rollback_to_original.sh
```

### Manual Restoration
If needed, manually copy files back:
```bash
# From this backup directory
cp conductor.py.backup ../conductor.py
cp data_synthesizer.py.backup ../data_synthesizer.py
cp python_chart_agent.py.backup ../python_chart_agent.py
cp mermaid_chart_agent.py.backup ../mermaid_chart_agent.py
cp analytics_agent.py.backup ../../analytics_agent.py
```

## Feature Flag

The new playbook system uses a feature flag:
```bash
# Enable new playbook system
export USE_PLAYBOOK_SYSTEM=true

# Disable and use original system
export USE_PLAYBOOK_SYSTEM=false
```

## Important Notes

- These backups represent a **fully working system**
- All files were tested and validated before backup
- Do NOT delete these backups until the new system is fully validated
- The rollback script will automatically restore all files

## System State at Backup Time

- ✅ All chart types working
- ✅ Synthetic data generation functional
- ✅ Both Mermaid and Python charts rendering
- ✅ MCP simplified implementation active
- ✅ All tests passing

---

*Keep these backups for at least 3 months after the playbook system is validated*
